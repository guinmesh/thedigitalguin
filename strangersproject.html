										<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/prototype2-girls.jpg" alt="Women drawing on the collective art installation during the day" /></span>Instruction sets for strangers is a project that sought to connect strangers through a shared task, interaction, or other manifestation of curiosity, <i>without giving these strangers any written or verbal instructions</i>. In order to serve our chosen venue and its occupants best, it was necessary to research and understand the space's historical significance, its unique elements, and how people currently interact within it.
										</p>
										<p>
											This project was created for Major Studio I (Interaction Design) at Parsons during the Fall 2021 semester, under the instruction of Harpreet Sareen. I worked with Pepper Xiao (Parsons MFA DT '23) and Duo Xu (Parsons MFA DT '23) to create a piece for multiple strangers to interact with in Washington Square Park, in New York, NY.
										</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-12">
										<p>
											For our project, we wanted to maximize interaction while maintaining simplicity. Since New York is a diverse, international city, we wanted the object to be accessible to a wide audience within the park. We decided to focus on the act of creation, using drawing as a means for the community of the park to create something together.
										</p>
										<p>
											We constructed a simple structure, which consisted of a three-sided drawing surface mounted on a tripod. Markers were attached to the structures with magnets and coins, and there were several blank circles drawn on the structure prior to exhibition to act as nonverbal guides.
										</p>

											The above video documents our final installation, <i>Collective Artwork in Washington Square Park</i>. It was taken over a 6-hour period. In it, you can see a large amount of interactions with the piece (we lost count - next time we'll bring a clicker to get an exact number!), groups gathering, folks lining up to leave their mark on the sculpture, and people examining the drawings that had been left by previous visitors. Some examples are shown here (portions are pixelated for decency).
										</p>
										<p>
											Overall, we found a great deal of success in the final installation of our instruction sets for strangers. It achieved several things: it brought strangers together, it instructed people to interact with the installation in a way that created a collective artwork, and it brought joy to a subpopulation of the park.

											We went through several stages of user research and iteration in this project.
										</p>
										<p>
											We engaged with photojournalism tactics, mind mapping, brainstorming trees, and the AEIOU method to research our target population. Duo, Pepper, and I did all of these both independently and as a group, collaboratively.
										</p>
										<p>
											By tracking and observing the Activities, Environment, Interactions, Objects, and Users (AEIOU) of Washington Square Park, we were able to identify common trends and patterns. How is the space used? Who are the participants?

											After researching our site and the target audience of this project, we began creating low fidelity prototypes and testing with the park population. We began by hanging a cloth installation across a walking path in the park, on the east side. This however, barely stopped any New Yorkers, and did not capture peoples' attention. In fact, several people walked directly into the installation.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											With these observations in mind, we decided to change our location, as well as make the piece more clearly interactive. We brought the installation to the main square, and we changed the form. Instead of a hanging, loose cloth, we attached foam core to a tripod. We also added markers to the exterior and drew guide circles (these could be heads, basketballs, etc., whatever people interpreted) to signal that people could draw on the foam core. We observed the reception of this iteration, then added our edits to the final version of the project.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											  In our final installation, we again iterated based on visitors' interactions with the sculpture. We made it sturdier, provided more circles for people to draw within, and added remote lights in order to make the piece stand out even further at night. We observed a huge rush of activity with these changes. In the video, you can see the unbelievable number of interactions we observed with our final form. People were excited to be a part of a collective artwork in Washington Square Park, and they even recruited their friends and strangers to participate.

										<p>
											Overall, this project was an overwhelming success. It achieved the goal of this project, to instruct strangers how to interact with an object without words or guidance, and it brought joy to the park, my studio course, and of course, my group members and I.
										</p>
										<p>
											In future iterations, we'd like to experiment more with form, get a clicker so that we can record the <i>exact</i> number of interactions, and consider alternative contexts, locations, and times that this installation would be successful in. We would also like to further explore how this might benefit marginalized communities within the park, like our houseless population. Moreover, to consider if this concept should be translated. E.g., What are the implications of interrupting and intervening in space, and what are the different dynamics of power that operate within different spaces within the park?
										</p>
										<p>
											We learned a great deal from this project, in terms of process, effective interaction tactics, and the intentions, uses, and symbolism of New York City parks. I would love to work with both Pepper and Duo again, so that we can see what other potential this project holds.
